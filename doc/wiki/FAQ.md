# Frequently asked questions

## General

### I'd like to use the 2FA with Threema for my own forum, but I don't use XenForo. Will there be any ports for other forum software?
Currently there are no plans to do so. However it is certainly possible and any developer can do so as the PHP SDK and this add-on are both open-source.

Basically it would be very good to have already some support for two-factor-authentication implemented in the forum software. (see next question)

### Why did you choose XenForo ?

The main reason was that XenForo v1.5 added Two-factor-authentication as native feature of XenForo and allowed it to be expanded by add-ons. Many users requested SMS 2FA.
However SMS is insecure (see "Why not just SMS?") and the Threema Gateway is just perfectly suitable for such a task as sending OTP (one time passwords) to users.

### Why did you choose Threema? I'd like to have WhatsApp instead!

This has several reasons:
1. WhatsApp is not more secure than SMS. Messages are usually send unencrypted and
2. WhatsApp does not yet have APIs which allow sending of such messages.

The advantages of Threema (Gateway) are:
1. The messages can be send end-to-end encrypted.
2. It is cheap. (cheaper than SMS)
3. The messages are all send through servers in Switzerland.
3. Threema allows you to accept/decline messages, which is used in the "Fast login" method

More advantages of the Threema Gateway can be found [on the official website](https://gateway.threema.ch).

### And why no other messenger like Telegram or Signal?
These messengers also have no API to send messages to users.

### Why not just SMS?
SMS is [insecure](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1374979/mobile-programming-how-secure-is-sms), [especially for 2FA](https://www.fredericjacobs.com/blog/2016/01/14/sms-login/) and the Threema Gateway is just perfectly suitable for such a task as sending OTP (one time passwords) to users.
Additionally sending messages with the Threema Gateway is cheaper than sending SMS messages.

### But the code generation method via app is more secure, isn't it?
Yes, it is as it works completely offline. That's also the reason why it is showed above the Threema 2FA methods when the user goes to the 2FA settings.

However 2FA verification with Threema is nearly as secure as the [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-time_Password_Algorithm) verification (that's how the app verification is called), but it may be much more convenient and the user can choose from several 2FA methods.
Additionally it is always good to have a second 2FA method activated as a backup.

## Setup and Problems

### I have installed the add-on. What to do now? How can I set it up?

See [Setup](../doc/setup.md).

### How can I setup a PHP keystore?

At first note that this is not needed as the database is used by default to store the public keys of Threema IDs.

1. Create a php file in `library\ThreemaGateway`, e.g. `library\ThreemaGateway\mykeystore.php`.
2. Make sure it is writable. If not e.g. use `chmod` to make it writable. You will get an error later if it is not writable.
3. Go to the Threema Gateway settings in the ACP and select "Use PHP Keystore (not recommend)".
4. Enter the filename (and extension) of your PHP keystore, e.g. `mykeystore.php`.
5. Save the changes.

### How can I hardcode my credentials into the PHP file?

When you do so, please be aware that every update of this addon overwrites these changes and therefore you have to do them again.

- Open the file `library\ThreemaGateway\Handler.php` and scroll near line 25. There you see the following code snippet:

  ```php
  /**
  * @var string $GatewayId Your own Threema Gateway ID
  */
  private $GatewayId = '';

  /**
  * @var string $GatewaySecret Your own Threema Gateway Secret
  */
  private $GatewaySecret = '';

  /**
  * @var string $PrivateKey Your own private key
  */
  private $PrivateKey = '';
  ```

- Replace the values in such a way that they e.g. look like this:

  ```php
  /**
  * @var string $GatewayId Your own Threema Gateway ID
  */
  private $GatewayId = '*MYAPIID';

  /**
  * @var string $GatewaySecret Your own Threema Gateway Secret
  */
  private $GatewaySecret = 'ab2defghijKlmnOp';

  /**
  * @var string $PrivateKey Your own private key
  */
  private $PrivateKey = 'private:94af3260fa2a19adc8e82e82be598be15bc6ad6f47c8ee303cb185ef860e16d2';
  ```

1. Now you can remove all data in the ACP options (just set them to a blank field) and if everything is correct you will still see your remaining credits. If not, there will be an error.

Note that the health check displays an error for the edited file afterwards. If you do not want this you can calculate the checksum of the changed file and replace it in `library\ThreemaGateway\Listener\FileHealthCheck.php`.

### Messages are not send or received. What should I do?

You should make sure you [setup](../doc/setup.md) everything correctly. Visit the ACP options page and look at the status. There you will eventually see error messages. Also make sure you have enough credits to send messages.

If this does not help, consider opening an issue.

## Customization

### How do I add smilies to my messages?
All messages this add-on sends are saved as phrases. As unicode emotions cannot be saved in phrases directly. However you can use Unicode characters in the format `\u<hexnum>`. You can use the same format as in C, C++ or Java source code (which use UTF-16). There are also [converters](https://www.branah.com/unicode-converter) for this task.

## Two-factor-authentication

### It does not display me the Threema 2FA methods. What's happening?

This add-on has multiple ways which deactivate one or more 2FA methods. Please make sure that...

1. Your server setup is complete (look at the status message in the ACP)
2. Your credentials are correct
3. The user group has enough permissions to use the specific 2FA method. E.g. for the conventional mode the users must have permission to use the Gateway, send messages, fetch public keys (lookup) and use the 2FA mode.
4. The 2FA method is activated in the settings.

### How can I hide a 2FA method?

There are multiple methods. You can hide one...

- for all users by disabling it in the settings
- for some user groups by removing the permission to use the Gateway. Note that this mostly affects multiple 2FA modes.

### I deactivated a 2FA mode, but users still use this mode to login. How is that possible?

When you disable a 2FA mode this only prevents users from activating this mode. Users, who had this mode activated before, do not notice any difference and can still login with this mode. This makes sure that no users get locked out.

If you want to prevent users from using the 2FA at all, you can only limit the permissions for the user/user group, so that they cannot use the Threema Gateway or the 2FA of the Threema Gateway anymore. However may cause issues with users, without any other 2FA method, because they will not only get errors, but will also have no way to login anymore. So be careful when disabling 2FA modes!

### What happens if I lose my Threema ID as a 2FA user?
If you lose access to your Threema ID you cannot use the 2FA method setup by using this ID anymore. You may use a backup code or another 2FA method if set up.
Always remember to [create a backup](https://threema.ch/en/faq/id_backup_expl) of your Threema ID to prevent such issues.
